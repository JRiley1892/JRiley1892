Hi there, I'm Jacob Riley! I'm a self-taught front-end developer passionate about creating beautiful, responsive websites that are both user-friendly and accessible.

My journey into web development started when I discovered my love for design and decided to teach myself how to code. I spent countless hours learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap and React. I'm always eager to learn more and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the industry.

I've worked on a variety of personal projects, including a responsive portfolio website and a JavaScript-based game. Through these projects, I've gained experience in web design and front-end development. I'm also familiar with Git and GitHub, and I understand the importance of version control in collaborative projects.

I'm excited to bring my skills and passion to a professional setting and am eager to start my career as a front-end developer. I'm a quick learner and a dedicated team player, and I'm always willing to go the extra mile to achieve my goals.

Thank you for considering me for your team!
